# OOBD_Project
It's an university project shared with @Lagiacrus3083. The goal is to address a specific problem by creating a database (UML -> logical schema -> physical schema using SQL) and developing a Java application with a graphical user interface (GUI). A series of PDFs will document the progress of the work leading to the completion of the project.
